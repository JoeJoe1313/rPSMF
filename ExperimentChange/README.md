# Experiment 2 - Change Point Detection

This directory contains the code to reproduce the experiments on change point 
detection in the [PSMF paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.03906).

To reproduce, open Matlab and run:

```matlab
> main
```

**Matlab Prerequisites:**

- `Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox`
