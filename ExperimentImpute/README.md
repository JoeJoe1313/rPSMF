# Missing Value Imputation Experiment

This experiments shows the success of PSMF and rPSMF for imputing missing 
values in time series data on several real-world datasets and different 
percentages of missing data.

The London air quality data is sourced from 
[https://londonair.org.uk](https://londonair.org.uk), the gas sensor dataset 
from the [UCI 
repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Gas+sensor+array+temperature+modulation) 
and the S&P 500 dataset was obtained from 
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/camnugent/sandp500).
