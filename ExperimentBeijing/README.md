# Beijing Air Quality Experiment

This experiment demonstrates the use of a nonlinear subspace model on periodic 
real-world data. The dataset is obtained from the [UCI 
repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Beijing+PM2.5+Data) and 
contains only the weather-related features (DEWP, TEMP, PRES).
